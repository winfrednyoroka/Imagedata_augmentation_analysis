# Image Clustering

## Motivation / Rationale

Machine learning for medical imaging has wide-reaching applications, spanning from analysis of microscopy slides to whole-organ MRIs. As medical imaging continues to play a vital role in diagnostics and treatment, drawing insights from image analysis is essential. Therefore, we believe that a training resource on image clustering would be of interest to students in the Bristol Medical School.  
Furthermore, imaging data sets are often relatively small which limit the performance of ML models. This training provides us with an opportunity to introduce students to data optimisation for machine learning e.g. through data augmentation. Through transformations like rotations, flips and colour adjustments, students will learn how to enhance dataset diversity, improve model generalisation, and mitigate overfitting which are critical skills for working with real world image data. 

## Aim
To teach the concept of image clustering for analysis of medical images using a publicly available data set. The course will introduce ideas on data optimisation techniques with a focus on data augmentation, to improve machine learning in small imaging datasets. 
## Materials and Methods
This course will aim to build on the pre-existing [image clustering training](https://bristol-training.github.io/applied-data-analysis-in-python/pages/appendix_clustering_images.html). It will utilise a publicly available medical images dataset e.g. the [HAM10000 dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DBW86T) - a large dermatology dataset that is already used in machine learning models. We will also aim to develop a small section introducing ideas on data augmentation via rotating images. This could include a practical element such as this [Data Camp example](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/complete-guide-data-augmentation).
